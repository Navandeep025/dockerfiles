# mysite_nginx.conf

# This conf file tells nginx to serve up media and static files from the filesystem,
# as well as handle requests that require Djangoâ€™s intervention. For a large deployment
# it is considered good practice to let one server handle static/media files, and
# another handle Django applications;

# the django component nginx needs to connect to
upstream django {
    # server unix:///path/to/your/mysite/mysite.sock; # for a file socket
    server web:8000; # for a web port socket (we'll use this first)
}

# The php-fpm component nginx needs to connect to
upstream php_fpm {
    # server unix:///path/to/your/mysite/mysite.sock; # for a file socket
    server php:9000; # for a web port socket (we'll use this first)
}
