MySQL 5.1 on Centos 6 image
===================

This image contains the MySQL version 5.1 enhanced to support an higher INNODB and MYISAM load. The  MySQL [tuning-primer.sh](https://launchpad.net/mysql-tuning-primer) script is provided inside the image in order to monitor database configuration. All MySQL data are written in `/var/lib/mysql` as a `VOLUME`. The `mysql_install_db` script is loaded in order to generate MySQL data directory for the first time. This directory is not generated by providing a MySQL `datadir` using docker volumes.

## Build the image

Build a MySQL image like this

```bash
$ docker build --rm -t bunop/centos6-mysql .
$ docker tag bunop/centos6-mysql:latest bunop/centos6-mysql:0.1
```

## Create a volume container for data dir

This practice is not strongly suggested but could facilitate data backup

```bash
$ docker create --name mysql-volume -v $PWD/mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \
  bunop/centos6-mysql /bin/true
```

## Run the image

You can run MySQL image and export MySQL `datadir` directory using a command like this:

```bash
$ docker run -d -P --volumes-from mysql-volume -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  --name mysql bunop/centos6-mysql
```

If the container is created for the first time, MySQL `datadir` is created. By passing an already
defined MySQL `datadir`, server start immediately without generate this directory.

**PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER!** To do so, start the container, and enter it:

```bash
$ docker exec -ti <container-name> /bin/bash
```

then  issue the following commands:

```bash

/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h 657f2447b4e4 password 'new-password'

# Alternatively you can run:
/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
```

## Connect to MySQL database outside container

In order to connect into database outside MySQL container, you have to create **at least** one user and setting from where the connection will be valid (root can only connect inside container). Enter the container and connect
to MySQL client simply by typing `mysql`, then:

```sql
CREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';
```
You can then grant privileges on specific databases.



## Running tuning-primer inside container

Enter the container with `docker exec` and then type:

```bash
$ tuning-primer.sh
```
